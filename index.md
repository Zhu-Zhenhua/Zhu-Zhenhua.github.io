# DOT-PIM Workshop



## Overview

In the era of artificial intelligence and big data, the von Neumann architecture with separated memory and computing is facing a serious "memory wall" problem. The data movements have become the main bottleneck limiting the performance and energy efficiency of hardware platforms. The emerging Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures provide an effective solution to overcome the memory wall problem. PIM architectures perform the in-situ matrix-vector multiplications in memory or general-purpose computing near memory, eliminating data movements between memory and computing units. Due to their high energy efficiency, PIM architectures are beneficial for embedded systems and gain increasing attention from academia and industry.

However, the new computing paradigm and emerging memory technologies bring serious design challenges for PIM. 
-	Firstly, the analog-domain computing of PIM is sensitive to circuit noises and device non-ideal factors. Efficient and precise circuit/device models are required.
- Secondly, the large-scale PIM architectures require an unacceptably long time of circuit simulation (e.g., SPICE), making the PIM architecture and chip design inefficient.
- Thirdly, the co-design space of intelligent algorithms and PIM architectures is extremely large. How to enable efficient software-hardware co-exploration becomes a research hotspot.

In view of the above challenges, this workshop will invite the leading experts from the PIM community to share their wonderful achievements in design and optimization tools for PIM. We hope DOT-PIM can help researchers to better understand the design challenges of PIM and inspire further research directions. It will also summarize and result in a survey paper about PIM design tools (submitted to related ACM/IEEE journals, e.g., ACM TODAES, IEEE TCAD, etc.). As a complement to ESWEEK, we believe DOT-PIM will enable a strong synergy between PIM architectures and embedded systems and propose potential ideas to achieve important progress in the future.

## Talks
### Keynote Speech 1. Prof. Onur Mutlu, ETH & CMU
#### Title: Memory-Centric Computing

Abstract:

Computing is bottlenecked by data. Large amounts of application data overwhelm storage capability, communication capability, and computation capability of the modern machines we design today. As a result, many key applications' performance, efficiency, and scalability are bottlenecked by data movement. In this lecture, we describe three major shortcomings of modern architectures in terms of 1) dealing with data, 2) taking advantage of the vast amounts of data, and 3) exploiting different semantic properties of application data. We argue that an intelligent architecture should be designed to handle data well. We show that handling data well requires designing architectures based on three key principles: 1) data-centric, 2) data-driven, 3) data-aware. We give several examples for how to exploit each of these principles to design a much more efficient and high-performance computing system. We especially discuss recent research that aims to fundamentally reduce memory latency and energy, and practically enable computation close to data, with at least two promising novels directions: 1) processing using memory, which exploits analog operational properties of memory chips to perform massively-parallel operations in memory, with low-cost changes, 2) processing near memory, which integrates sophisticated additional processing capability in memory controllers, the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory technologies, or memory chips to enable high memory bandwidth and low memory latency to near-memory logic. We show both types of architectures can enable orders of magnitude improvements in performance and energy consumption of many important workloads, such as graph analytics, database systems, machine learning, video processing, climate modeling, genome analysis. We discuss how to enable  adoption of such fundamentally more intelligent architectures, which we believe are key to efficiency, performance, and sustainability. We conclude with some research opportunities in and guiding principles for future computing architecture and system designs.

### Keynote Speech 2. Prof. Yu (Kevin) Cao, University of Minnesota
#### Title: HISIM: Heterogeneous Integration Simulator with 2.5D/3D Interconnect Modeling

Abstract:

The scaling trend of in-memory computing (IMC) is still lagging the ever-increasing demand of cognitive algorithms. More disruptive innovations, such as chiplet-based heterogeneous integration, will be critical to scaling up the system and speeding up the computation. We propose HISIM to evaluate the performance of monolithic, 2.5D, and 3D chiplet systems. HISIM integrates the technology roadmap of 2.5D/3D wires, conducts electrical modeling and analysis, and performs cycle-accurate simulations of data movement. We demonstrate HISIM with IMC elements on DNNs, transformers, and graph neural networks, to illustrate tradeoffs in placement/routing, latency and thermal issues.

### Invited Talk 1. Prof. Huaqiang Wu, Tsinghua University
#### Title: Full-stack Deployment and Design tools for RRAM-based Compute-in-memory System

Abstract:

In this talk, full-stack deployment and design tools are introduced for RRAM-based compute-in-memory (CIM) systems, which are helpful for optimizing on-chip inference flow and accelerating the system design. We introduced Software-hardware co-optimization methods into the deployment tools, which can significantly improve the on-chip inference performance, such as accuracy, latency, and so on. Moreover, hierarchical simulation models in the design tools are introduced to accurately evaluate the performance of different system designs. Finally, with the full-stack software tools, we demonstrated versatile neural networks on a CIM system with multiple RRAM chips and designed a NOC-based CIM architecture with 100M RRAM cells.

### Invited Talk 2. Dr. Abbas Rahimi, IBM
#### Title: A neuro-vector-symbolic architecture for data- and compute-efficient continual learning, abstract reasoning, and combinatorial inference

Abstract:

Neuro-symbolic AI approaches display both perception and reasoning capabilities, but inherit the limitations of their individual deep learning and symbolic AI components. By combining neural networks and vector-symbolic architecture machinery, we propose the concept of neuro-vector-symbolic architecture (NVSA). NVSA solves few-shot continual learning, visual abstract reasoning, and computationally hard problems such as factorization faster and more accurately than other state-of-the-art methods. We also show how the efficient realization of NVSA can be informed and benefitted by the physical properties of in-memory computing hardware, e.g., O(1) MVM, in-situ progressive crystallization, and intrinsic stochasticity of phase-change memory devices.

### Invited Talk 3. Prof. Li Jiang, Shanghai Jiao Tong University & Huawei
#### Title: Opportunities and Challenges for Process-In-Memory (PIM) Technology in ICT Products

Abstract:

PIM technology, which puts computing elements near memory banks, has been studied in academia for decades, emphasized in deep learning scenarios. Samsung, SK Hynix, and UPMEM also announced some industrial POC products. However, it still has a big gap before the mainstream adoption of PIM. In this talk, we advertise memory I/O-intensive (but not compute-intensive) applications suitable for PIM technology, e.g., big data analytics,  database, storage, and data communication scenarios. We will elaborate on PIM's great potential to improve the effective memory bandwidth, offload poor cache locality operations, and reduce data movement in these general applications. Nevertheless, we will highlight some system and architecture challenges induced by the heterogeneity of computing and memory.

#### Title: EDA Toolchain for Processing-in-Memory CNN Accelerators

Abstract:

Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are widely used for CNN acceleration with excellent performance and energy efficiency. However, currently there lacks EDA tools to design PIM-based CNN accelerators. This talk will introduce several EDA tools for PIM architecture design and simulation, including an architecture synthesis framework, a CNN compiler targeted at PIM architectures, and a PIM simulator. The synthesis tool automatically generates PIM architectures under given constraints. The compiler converts an ONNX-described CNN to an instruction stream for a given architecture. The simulator estimates the performance, power dissipation and energy consumption of the instruction stream running on the given architecture.

### Invited Talk 7. Prof. Yaoyu Tao, Peking University
#### Title: Fast and Reconfigurable Sort-In-Memory System Enabled By Memristors

Abstract:

Sorting is fundamental and ubiquitous in modern computing systems for artificial intelligence, database, or web search. Existing sorting systems utilize Von Neumann architecture and comparison operations, but their performance is limited by data bandwidth between memory and comparison units. Sort-in-memory (SIM) is desired but not yet available due to comparison operations that are nontrivial to be implemented in memory. Here we introduce a fast and reconfigurable memristor-based SIM system using digit read (DR) to eliminate comparison operations and tree node skipping (TNS) on DR tree that supports variable data quantity and data types. We extend TNS with multi-bank, bit-slice, and multi-level strategies for cross-array TNS (CA-TNS) with higher scalability and parallelism. Experimented across five benchmark sorting datasets, our SIM system presents up to 3.32x~7.70x speedup, 6.23x~183.5x energy efficiency and 2.23x~7.43x area reduction compared with existing sorting systems. 
We further adopt such SIM system in two representative real-world applications, shortest path search with Dijkstra's algorithm and neural network with run-time tunable sparsity, demonstrating its capability in solving practical sorting problems and compatibility in integrating with other compute-in-memory (CIM) techniques. The memristor-based SIM approaches push sorting into a new paradigm of sort-in-memory for next-generation sorting system.

### Senior Ph.D. Student Talk 1. Mr. Yuan-Chun Luo, GIT.
### Advisor: Prof. Shimeng Yu
#### Title: Benchmarking framework for non-volatile capacitive compute-in-memory

Abstract:

Non-volatile capacitive compute-in-memory (CIM) offers higher energy and area efficiency compared to its resistive counterpart. However, the impact of device-to-device variation and temporal noise on the system-level performance remains unexplored. This presentation will first introduce the device-level innovation using ferroelectric materials and the array-level operating principle. Then, an end-to-end methodology will be presented to incorporate experimentally measured device-to-device variation into the design space exploration, from capacitive weight cell design, CIM array with peripheral circuits, to the inference accuracy of deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. Finally, the capacitive CIM will be benchmarked against the resistive approach, showing 6.95× and 14.1× higher TOPS/W×TOPS/mm2 for ResNet-50 and SwinV2-T respectively.
